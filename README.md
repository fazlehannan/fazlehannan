# 🌟 Hi, I’m **Fazle Hanan**

I believe in the philosophy of Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, which is to study what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible. Transitioning from a research background in Computer Vision, and motivated by my love for tangents and playful exploration—something I personally felt was limited in research—I am moving into Cloud, DevOps, modern infrastructure engineering, and other technologies aimed at building scalable, automated, and cost-efficient systems.

I focus on deeply understanding real-world problems and engineering robust, end-to-end solutions that leverage cloud platforms, DevOps practices, and their intersection with other technologies to unlock new value. Following this approach, I continue to learn whatever I find essential—guided by exploration and curiosity rather than rigid, predefined curriculums that can limit innovation.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to contribute and collaborate on building reliable, resilient, and high-impact solutions to complex real-world challenges.
