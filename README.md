# 🌟 Hi, I’m **Fazle Hanan**

I believe in the philosophy of Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, which is to study what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible. Transitioning from a research background in Computer Vision, and motivated by my love for tangents and playful exploration—something I personally felt was limited in research.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to contribute and collaborate on building reliable, resilient, and high-impact solutions to complex real-world challenges.
